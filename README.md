# Crime-Analysis-Prediction-System
The project involves data mining algorithms used to mine patterns and trends in the occurrence of crimes in any city, with respect to day of a week, time of the day and place in a city.

Programming Language: JAVA

Algorithms Used:
1. Kernel Density Estimation
2. Robust Clustering Algorithm for Categorical Attributes
3. K-Medoid Clustering Algorithm

Achieved an overall precision of 72% in predicting criminal activities in my home city (Pune), with respect to a particular timeframe of the day, day of a week and identifying a vulnerable locality in the city.
